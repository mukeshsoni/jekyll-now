            Written by <strong>Mukesh Soni</strong>. Now looking for a frontend
            gig. Good at JavaScript, reactjs and family. Knows and has worked in
            nodejs. Been doing this stuff for 7 years (since 2011).

          I transitioned into web development from a business analyst role 7
          years back and have never looked back.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like the ideas behind functional programming and try to use them as
          much as possible in my own code. Immutability rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love looking into ways to make a developers life easier and try
          building tools to improve developer productivity. This i do in my free
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently use reactjs and redux for writing complex frontend
          applications. Have decent knowledge about CSS, Haskell and elm too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have been getting into `react-native` of late and loving it.
          `react-native` might be the future of mobile development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Know a little bit of purescript, haskell and elm. You can ask me about
          functors ðŸ˜œ.
