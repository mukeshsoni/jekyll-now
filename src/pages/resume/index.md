> I am good at JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, reactjs and family. I have also worked in nodejs. I have been doing web development since 2011 and loved most of the journey. I am still super excited about the future of web development.

I always keep performance in mind when building websites. It's become harder and
harder to keep a tab on site performance with an explosion of easy to use third
party libraries. It's never been easier to build awesome sites. But it's also
never been easier to build a slow one.

My technology of choice when building sites is html, css, javascript, typescript, reactjs, and nodejs.

I like the ideas behind functional programming and try to use them as much as possible in my own code. Immutability rules. I have dabbled a bit in purely functional programming languages like Elm and Haskell.

Would love to like a little rust because of the novel concepts it brings to
programming.

I like writing open source code code in my free time. Some of my personal work can be found on github - [https://github.com/mukeshsoni](https://github.com/mukeshsoni).

## Past work

#### Saltside (June 2018 - present)
At [Saltside](https://saltside.se/), I worked on architecting and rewriting the saltside sites (https://bikroy.com, https://ikman.lk, https://tonaton.com) as responsive Single Page Applications. I was responsible to analyze the business requirements and make the initial technology decisions for frontend. Site performance was one of the key requirements when doing the rewrite. We also tried our best to keep the site as accessible as possible to people with disabilities.

The main challenges involved in the rewrite were
1. Writing code which worked for all three markets.
2. Server rendering the react code with good code splitting. Server rendering
   was a strict requirement because of SEO.
3. Having small JavaScript bundle sizes as our users were mostly in
   countries with low bandwidth internet connections.
4. The sites had to work responsively across mobile and desktop. Keeping the
   bundle size small while working seamlessly on mobile and desktop very
   challenging.
5. The site should use semantic html to be accessible to people with
   disabilities.

I was also responsible for mentoring the team members in writing idiomatic html,
css, javascript and typescript. We built our own component library from scratch. This gave
us full control over the components. We could keep the components small since
they were built for our specific requirements. We still made the code generic
enough for extensibility.

I was also responsible for onboarding new members to the new code base.
Onboarding new developers gave me key insights into the complexity of modern
frontend development.

Technologies used

* HTML, CSS, Sass
* TypeScript
* React (ReactJS) and preactjs (with server side rendering) for UI
* redux for state management
* node.js - for serving static content, server side rendering, and a proxy for API endpoints
* Jest for unit testing
* Cypress for functional testing

#### Projectplace (June 2014 - March 2018)
At projectplace, I played a key role in getting the company to move from backbone views to Reactjs to be used for the view part. Have developed a number of reactjs components of various complexities over the past 4 years. Also responsible for maintainance of frontend code of part of the site.

* Convinced the company to adopt reactjs in 2014 when reactjs was quite young. Did multiple prototypes and gave multiple presentations showcasing the developer productivity boost reactjs brought in.

* Rewrote the frontend for the commenting system used on projectplace.com from scratch. The commenting system is now used on every tool on the site. It's also used by the more general conversation tool on the site.

* Rewrote the frontend for documents management system on projectplace.com from scratch, along with a colleague.

* Wrote the frontend for a new tool, called roadmap, (along with a colleague) on projectplace.com. The tool is supposed to be used by Product owners or higher up in the management to setup the roadmap for products or services or product lines altogether.

* Moved the build system for our frontend code from gulp based tasks to webpack. We had multiple codebases for legacy system and a new system running parallely, which made the transition very challenging.

* Brought in a number of functional programming ideas into the frontend community at projectplace. In my own journey to learn functional programming, i learnt haskell and dipped my toes into learning PureScript and Elm. In my personal projects, i try and use static typing and functional paradigms as much as possible (need based, of course).

#### Freelancing
As a freelancer, i did a project for TP Vision from Nov 2013 - Feb 2014.

Built an authentication/reporting server for android based smart TVs (by TPVision). The smart tvs in question would be able to enjoy other services in the tv only after authenticating with a central server. This server is designed to handle upto 10-20 million television authentications in a day. The authentication is digest based and sends across a 11kb payload as response.

The server handles 600 requests per second running on a 4 core i7 machine with 2 gb RAM.

#### BrizzTV (Dec 2011 - Oct 2013) 
In BrizzTV, i was simultaneously working on more than one project most of the time. Some of the noteworthy ones are mentioned below -

* [MCUBE android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brizztv.mcube) - An app which recognizes expenses by reading incoming sms. Pulls the amount from the expense, auto categorizes it based on sms text and past mappings and files it under the corrent account number. Takes the biggest pain, i.e. opening an app and filing an expense, out of the equation. The auto categorization keeps getting better with each incoming sms.

* Made a backend systems which pulls tweets from specific handles, hashtags, search strings from twitter (using twitter api), stores them in our system and pushes them to television channels (real time tweets on tv).

I also made the front end for specifying rules by which a tweet is connected to a particular channel as well as the front end to manage the handles, hash tags and search strings for pulling the tweets.

* Ad overlay for youtube videos
  I made a popcorn maker like UI but only for adding ads to youtube videos. User could tag photo(s) or text to particular part of the scene and specify the duration for which the ad was to be shown. It's like a video tagger but for youtube only.

* Made an intuitive ad inventory management and scheduling system (both UI and backend) for ad publishers.

The ad inventory was for showing ads on custom movie channels. The idea is to show free movies on television but with permanent ads on the side and bottom. To enjoy ad free movie, subscription is required.

I made the system to maintain the ads, their publisher details, scheduling details and a system to automatically push ads to the proper tv channel at the right time.

* I made the interface and backend to push content directly from browser to any tv channel (assuming you have credentials for the channel server). The push system is realtime (about 5 seconds delay).

---

#### Infosys (June 2006 - October 2011)
I was a business analyst for multiple multi million dollar project while i was working at Infosys.

* My last project was a 2 year long project for building an application for Apple to manage and automate the process of setting prices for products before the product launch.

* I spent one year as part of a Data Quality solutions team. I wrote data cleansing scripts which gave me immense joy.
