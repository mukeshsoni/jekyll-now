As a freelancer, i did a project for TP Vision from Nov 2013 - Feb 2014.

Built an authentication/reporting server for android based smart TVs (by TPVision). The smart tvs in question would be able to enjoy other services in the tv only after authenticating with a central server. This server is designed to handle upto 10-20 million television authentications in a day. The authentication is digest based and sends across a 11kb payload as response.

 The server handles 600 requests per second running on a 4 core i7 machine with 2 gb RAM.

In BrizzTV, i was simultaneously working on more than one project most of the time. Some of the noteworthy ones are mentioned below - 

- [MCUBE android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brizztv.mcube) - An app which recognizes expenses by reading incoming sms. Pulls the amount from the expense, auto categorizes it based on sms text and past mappings and files it under the corrent account number. Takes the biggest pain, i.e. opening an app and filing an expense, out of the equation. The auto categorization keeps getting better with each incoming sms.

- Made a backend systems which pulls tweets from specific handles, hashtags, search strings from twitter (using twitter api), stores them in our system and pushes them to television channels (real time tweets on tv).

 I also made the front end for specifying rules by which a tweet is connected to a particular channel as well as the front end to manage the handles, hash tags and search strings for pulling the tweets.
 
 You can see the product live on airtel DTH on many channels.
 
- Ad overlay for youtube videos
I made a popcorn maker like UI but only for adding ads to youtube videos. User could tag photo(s) or text to particular part of the scene and specify the duration for which the ad was to be shown. It's like a video tagger but for youtube only.

 Made a corresponding chrome extension which allows a user to view relevant ad overlays on youtube videos.  The idea was to show ads relevant to what someone is wearing/holding in that particular scene. 

- Made an intuitive ad inventory management and scheduling system (both UI and backend) for ad publishers. 
 
 The ad inventory was for showing ads on custom movie channels. The idea is to show free movies on television but with permanent ads on the side and bottom. To enjoy ad free movie, subscription is required. 
 
 I made the system to maintain the ads, their publisher details, scheduling details and a system to automatically push ads to the proper tv channel at the right time.
 
- I made the interface and backend to push content directly from browser to any tv channel (assuming you have credentials for the channel server). The push system is realtime (about 5 seconds delay).

I was a business analyst for multiple multi million dollar project while i was working in Infosys.

- My last project was a 2 year long project for building an application for Apple to manage and automate the process of setting prices for products (across geographies and org structure) before the product launch. The system helped Apple manage and collaborate the process on fixing prices at a very low level (MPN level).
 
- I spent one year as part of a Data Quality solutions team, where I was associated with solution designing, development, and business consulting as data expert for several Fortune 500 organizations. I also wrote data cleansing scripts which gave me immense joy. The product we worked on is called [DataFlux](http://support.sas.com/software/products/dataflux/) (now taken over by SAS).
